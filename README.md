# simple_flipkart_demo_website
This is totally small e-commerce website using MongoDB, NodeJS -Express, and HTML,CSS,Bootstrap.

# For dataBase we used mongoDB and uploading the database by running "node data_loader.js"
# Then the server file will run using "npm start or node index.js"
Server will start running localhost:3001
you can see the JSON data onb localhost:3001/products
and now once server starts running you can open the HTML page by typing localhost:3001/home.html


# Things to remember :
For installing mongo type "npm install mongo"
You should see the port number of the mongo by typing "mongo"
To see the database type: mongo
                          show dbs
